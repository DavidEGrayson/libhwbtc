The goal of this project is to build a high-quality C/C++ library 
and command-line interface for hardware Bitcoin wallets such as the TREZOR.

I started this because I would like to be able to check my TREZOR's 
balance and move funds without using 
[mytrezor.com](https://mytrezor.com) and without downloading the
Bitcoin blockchain.
